# Title Explorer

Search for movies and TV Shows

# Endpoints

* `GET /api/search?title={title}`
    * Search by a Title
    * Returns a list of results

* `GET /api/search?id={id}`
    * Search for a specific Movie or TV Show, using a IMDb ID
    * Returns information on the specific Movie or TV Show


# Running Locally

Prerequisites:
* Install the dependencies with `pipenv install --dev`

1. Start the `neo4j` Docker Container
    * `docker run --name neo4j-container -v $PWD/neo4j/data:/data -v $PWD/neo4j/logs:/logs --env NEO4J_AUTH="neo4j/pass" -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 --rm neo4j:3.5.3`
2. Start the application
    * `pipenv run python -m title_explorer`

# Example Graph

An example graph can be generated by running the `neo4j` instance along with the `title_explorer` server, and running the python file in [resources/python/example_graph](./resources/python/example_graph.py)

This will create a graph of the [MCU movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe).

A nice visualization can then be found at `localhost:7474`.

Use `neo4j` as the username and `pass` as the password, and run the cypher query:

* `MATCH (n1)-[r]->(n2) RETURN r, n1, n2`

The relationships are from `Person` to `Title`:

* `Paul Rudd` stars_in `Ant-Man`
* `Joe Russo` directed `Avengers: Infinity War`

# Goals

* [x] Get acquainted with `asyncio` in Python
* [x] Become familiar with webscraping using [`BeautifulSoup`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
* [x] Store data in a graph database
